# Bat-Tools-Collection

## 1. MergeAllTextFiles
 How It Works:

    The script now loops through all files in the directory, regardless of their extension.
    It reads the content of each file and appends it to the output.txt file.
    The script skips the output file itself to avoid self-inclusion.

How to Use:

    Place the merge.bat batch file in the same directory as the files you want to combine.
    Run the .bat file by double-clicking it or executing it from the command line.

This will generate an output.txt file containing the combined text of all files in the directory.
